ActEV Scoring Software
Version: 0.0.1
Date: January 25, 2018

This software package contains a scoring script for the TRECVID
Activities in Extended Video (ActEV) task.  The script
"ActEV_Scorer.py", is a Python 2.7 script that will validate and score
a system output file adhering to the JSON format defined in the ActEV
evaluation plan.  A collection of unit and integration test cases have
also been included, see the 'Setup' section for more detail.

ActEV_Scorer.py, when run with the '-h' option, will show the script's
usage text.  The "example_run.sh" contains an example of typical usage
(using the provided test data)

Setup:

  This package assumes a Unix-like environment.  Included Python files
  are written for Python 2.7.

  1) Install Python 2.7, if not already installed
  2) Install the following Python packages (version number used for
     development):
     - munkres (1.0.12)
     - scipy (1.0.0)
     - matplotlib (2.0.2)
  3) Run the tests (optional, but strongly recommended)
     % make check

Option description:

  SCORING_PROTOCOL - Positional argument, from a fixed set of values
  (e.g. ActEV18).  This required argument controls what system output
  formats are valid, and what metrics are computed.  A description of
  each supported protocol can be found in the "Protocols" section of
  this document

  -s SYSTEM_OUTPUT_FILE - Required; path to the system output JSON
  file to be scored

  -r REFERENCE_FILE - Required; path to the reference JSON file to
  score against

  -a ACTIVITY_INDEX - Required; path to activity index JSON file.
  This file lists what activities the system output will be evaluated
  on

  -f FILE_INDEX - Required; path to file index JSON file.  This file
  lists the files, and temporal ranges within those files, that the
  system output will be evaluated on ( **NOTE** currently the temporal
  ranges specified in FILE_INDEX are not used when considering what
  portion of the system output and reference to evaluate, and are only
  used to compute the duration of files.  This will be implemented in
  a future release)

  -o OUTPUT_DIR - Required; directory for computed scores and figures

  -d - Optional; by default, the script will produce a Detection Error
  Tradeoff (DET) curve figure for each activity and a combined figure
  of all activity curves.  If the '-d' option is set, no DET curves
  will be produced by the script

  -v - Optional; if enabled, the script will be more verbose
  (i.e. provide some scoring progress information)

Protocols:

  ActEV18 - Scoring protocol for the ActEV 2018 evaluation, the
  following measures are computed:
    - PMiss at RFA for RFA values of 1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.03, and
      0.01
    - NMIDE (**NOTE** currently using a no-score collar size of 0
      frames, this will likely change in a future release)

Changelog:
